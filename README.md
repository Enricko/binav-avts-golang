## Introduction

Golang Gin is a popular web framework for building RESTful APIs and web applications in Go. This repository provides custom templates that can be used with Gin to quickly scaffold new projects or generate code snippets.

## Installation

To use the custom templates, you need to have Golang and Gin installed on your machine. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Golang by following the instructions on the official website: [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/)

2. Install Gin by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin
    ```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/enricko/golang-gin-templates.git
    ```

## Usage

Once you have the custom templates and Gin installed, you can start using them in your projects. Here are a few examples:

1. To create a new Gin project using a custom template, run the following command:

    ```shell
    gin new -t path/to/template myproject
    ```

2. To generate a code snippet from a template, use the following command:

    ```shell
    gin gen -t path/to/template -o path/to/output/file
    ```
